Why is it called Ransack Search.

Well I origionally called it phpRansack, but PHP ask that people dont stick PHP infront of their project, so I removed it.
I wanted to put Some part of Agent Ransack into the title, because its Agent Ransack that does all the work, but I felt using the
full name would be a bit a bit cheeky.
